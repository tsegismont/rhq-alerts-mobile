#RHQ Alerts Mobile

RHQ Alerts Mobile is an Ionic/Cordova based application which gives RHQ users the list of unacknowledged alerts (much like the recent alert portlets does).

When a user touch an alert item, he gets the details and may acknowledge the alert.

##Done
* [X] Screen design with data mocking (see screenshots below)
* [X] Initial testing on an Android phone

##Todo
* [ ] Get user credentials and display real data from REST calls
* [ ] Add Aerogear push plugin to wake up the app when a new alert has been fired
* [ ] Testing on iOS devices

##Screenshots

Please pay no attention to the bad english in text, this is just mock data after all!
